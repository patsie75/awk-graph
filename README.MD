# awk-graph

Not something borrowed this time, but an original.<br>
I'm not sure when I've written this, but it is many years ago already.
Recently rediscovered and modified a bit to my current standards.<br>
Also introduced UTF-8 style bars, so the precision has increased a bit over the old 3-level circles.<br>

It will draw a graph based on data from stdin. First value will be the height of the graph, the rest of the values the data.<br>

i.e.: <code>graph 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code><br>

Here's a static image of some random data from <code>graphtest.sh</code>:<br>
