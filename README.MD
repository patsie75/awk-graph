# awk-graph

Not something 'borrowed' this time, but an original.
I'm not sure when I've written this, but it is many years ago already.
Recently rediscovered and modified a bit to my current standards.
Also introduced UTF-8 style bars, so the precision has increased a bit over the old 3-level circles.

pics and some video will follow soon
